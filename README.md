## Problem Statement

Recommendation systems have been an essential part of company infrastructure and sales techniques for quite some time, which in cases has led to economic- as well as technological growth. Google, Netflix, Amazon and Spotify are a handful of well-known companies famous for their recommendation systems and their technological- and economical growth. A recommendation system today is a broad subject and can, on a high abstraction level, be divided into different areas with different implementations for different occasions.In today's dynamic world of technology and in the face of this pandemic, it's critical for a growing e-commerce company to engage its customers and ensure their shopping safety.Instead of physical shopping, we are encouraging users to shop for their favourite items on a single site, and recommending those relevant items to them is more impressive and offers a greater sense of satisfaction.

## Future Scope
This project currently runs on local storage, but it can be transferred to cloud storage like IMGUR, AWS, AZURE, Cloudinary for unlimited storage and faster website loading. More features like User can upload his desired clothing item on our website, and get similar items and have specific search results; Full duplex portal, where Organisation can upload their clothing apparels anytime they want, and changes are reflected towards user side too.
