## Problem Statement

Recommendation systems have been an essential part of company infrastructure and sales techniques for quite some time, which in cases has led to economic- as well as technological growth. Google, Netflix, Amazon and Spotify are a handful of well-known companies famous for their recommendation systems and their technological- and economical growth. A recommendation system today is a broad subject and can, on a high abstraction level, be divided into different areas with different implementations for different occasions.In today's dynamic world of technology and in the face of this pandemic, it's critical for a growing e-commerce company to engage its customers and ensure their shopping safety. Instead of physical shopping, we are encouraging users to shop for their favourite items on a single site, and recommending those relevant items to them is more impressive and offers a greater sense of satisfaction.
